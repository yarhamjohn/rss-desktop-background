# rss-desktop-background
Sets the desktop background image from an RSS feed

The .bat file contains an example using the NASA image of the day RSS feed available here: https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/lg_image_of_the_day.rss

One way to use this might be to set up a Windows Task to run on system boot. The program will obtain the latest .jpg from the feed, save it to disk and set the desktop background.
